1. What is CMake?

CMake is a tool that generates build files based on scripts (CMakeLists.txt)
It can be used to build, test and package software.

2. What role do targets play in CMake?

A CMake target corresponds to an executable or a library. Like objects,
targets can be constructed (add_executable() or add_library()),
and they can be modified (set sources, add compile options, set included directories,
link libraries)

3. How would you proceed to optimize code?

Optimization of already written and correct code can be effectively
done in iterations. Every iteration, bottlenecks/hotspots need
to be identified, and then the programmer has to choose the suiting
technique to improve the performance of the application at those
hotspots. Depending on the hotspot or bottleneck, the programmer
has to modify the algorithm used, or he needs to parallelize or
vectorize the code if CPU throughput is the problem, or he has
to improve the cache usage of the program if the computation
at that hotspot/bottleneck is bandwidth-bound.
