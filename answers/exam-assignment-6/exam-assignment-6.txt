1. Name some characteristics of the instruction sets:

SSE:
-Works with 128-bit vectors
-the 16 CPU vector registers are named xmm0 to xmm15
AVX(2):
-Works with 256-bit vectors
-the 16 CPU vector registers are named ymm0 to ymm15
AVX-512:
-Works with 512-bit vectors
-the 32 CPU vector registers are named zmm0 to zmm31

2. How can memory aliasing affect performance?

When two pointers point to the same or overlapping memory locations
it is called memory aliasing. Without further information, the
compiler is forced to make conservative assumptions about
variables when aliasing is possible, leading to less optimized code.
By restricting pointers (stating that they are not aliased) the
compiler can perform optimizations that were not possible before,
for example constant propagation or code reordering.

3. What are the advantages of unit stride (stride 1) memory
access compared to accessing memory with larger strides (e.g. 8)?

Stride 1 access improves spatial locality usually much more
than larger strides. If for example an (aligned) array of a given type
(e.g. double) allows 8 data elements to fit into a cache line,
accessing these data elements with stride 1 access leads
to 1 RAM memory access followed by 7 cache hits. Stride 8 access
to 8 elements leads to 8 subsequent cache misses, as each element accessed
resides on a different cache line.

4. When would you prefer arranging records in memory as Structure
of Arrays?

Structure of Arrays is suitable if the records need to be read/processed
with maximum performance and if they can be processed in batches per each record field.
This layout leads to high spatial locality for the record fields inside
each array, which is cache-friendly and makes it easier for the compiler
to vectorize the code automatically. This is the case for example
in visual and graphics computing.
