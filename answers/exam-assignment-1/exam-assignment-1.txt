1. Describe how parallelism differs from concurrency.

The concept of concurrency describes the ability of a system to have 
multiple processes running simultaneously. This can be archieved by running
the processes on different cpu's and/or having one or more processes share
a cpu. The first solution can be called true parallelism, which means 
that multiple processes can really be executed simultaneously.
The second solution to realize concurrency is often referred to as
apparent parallelism (scheinbarer Parallelismus) and is realized
by executing each process for short amount of time and frequently switching
the currently executed process. This kind of concurrency requires the maintainance of
the state of each process, usually referred to as process context.
In conclusion, parallelism is a form of concurrency which relies on hardware
ressources to execute processes simultaneously and thereby 

2. What is fork-join-parallelism?

Fork-join-parallelism is a kind of parallelism that is realized
through forks and joins. On a start of a section that should be
executed in parallel, the desired amount of processes - 1 is forked
(created by copying the process context) from the process
of the main program. All processes now enter the section that is
supposed to be executed in parallel. They execute this section and
when every process is finished executing they signal the process that 
forked them that they are done. When the process of the main program
got the join signal from every forked process, he can continue running.

4. Read the paper ... and explain the figure "Performance gains after 
Moore's law ends.

The figure gives an overview about 'high-level' ways to increase
computing performance, in contrast to 'low-level' performance gains
that in the past were usually achieved by increasing the number of
transistors on a chip (described by Moore's law). As the transistor density
on CPU's reaches it's physical limits, other ways to increase
performance gain importance. The figure names 3 approaches to this:

By writing code in such a way that acknowledges the underlying hardware
architecture,
